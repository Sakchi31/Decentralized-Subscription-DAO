# Decentralized Subscription DAO

## Project Description

The Decentralized Subscription DAO is a smart contract-based platform designed to manage and distribute subscription funds among creators transparently. Subscribers pay a fixed monthly fee, and DAO administrators distribute these funds to registered creators based on performance, content quality, or other off-chain metrics.

## Project Vision

To empower digital creators through decentralized and transparent recurring payment systems while giving supporters a governance voice in content funding.

## Key Features

- Subscription system with monthly fee configuration.
- Creator registration and fund distribution logic.
- Track subscription history and creator earnings.
- Permissioned administrative functions for DAO governance.
- Upgradeable fee model to adapt to different tiers or networks.

## Future Scope

- DAO voting for fund distribution based on token-weighted scores.
- Integration with identity solutions (e.g., ENS or decentralized IDs).
- Creator reputation scores based on subscriber feedback.
- NFT-based access tiers for premium content.
- Cross-chain subscription mechanisms.
